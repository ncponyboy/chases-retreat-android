/**
 * Three-phase reconnection backoff.
 * Phase 1 (attempts 0–4, quick recovery):    0 → 500ms → 1s → 2s → 4s — transient blips.
 * Phase 2 (attempts 5–9, brief outages):      8s → 15s → 30s → 60s → 120s — tunnel / modem drop.
 * Phase 3 (attempts 10+, indefinite):         120s steps — server reboot, long travel.
 *
 * After Phase 2 the delay caps at 120s. The combined window for the default 20 attempts
 * is ~24 minutes — long enough for almost any transient outage (WireGuard reconnect,
 * modem reboot, tunnel dropout), short enough to surface a clean error state before
 * the user loses patience.
